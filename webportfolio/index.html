	<h2>Welcome to my portfolio!</h2>
	<p>
		Hello! I'm John, a web designer and developer based in Prince George's County, Maryland. 
		Eager to bring my clients' visions to life, I'm unafraid to work independently but remain willing to ask for clarifications, 
		keeping self-improvement in mind to become the best asset I can be. 
	<!--<br/><u class="trigger" onclick="toggleBasic(document.querySelector('#aboutExpansion'),this)">More&hellip;</u>-->

	<!--<div id="aboutExpansion">-->
	<p>
		Holding an animation/multimedia certificate from Prince George's Community College and a Bachelor's degree in digital media and web technology from the University of Maryland Global Campus, 
		I plan to continue honing my skills after college, 
		borrowing from a background in art and graphic design to create sites that prize atmosphere and visual balance. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Web technology has always been subject to change, and I intend to keep myself up to date by looking into new features for platforms and languages as soon as they're updated while 
		emphasizing the timeless theories at the core of Web design and keeping compatibility in mind. While my earliest websites were built with desktop machines in mind, 
		my later websites continuously apply responsive design techniques to ensure that they fit any screen size without needing a secondary page or mobile site.
	</p>
	<p>
		I primarily work in HTML, CSS and JavaScript for my sites, although I have also have experience designing sites in website-building platforms including Wix, Weebly and Google Sites. 
		I first learned how to code for the Web in 2015, and from there I took to building sites in HTML as a hobby before turning it into both a college major and a profession.

	<h2>Sites</h2>
	<p>
		When I first discovered HTML in 2015, I realized the world of possibilities that Web technology could lead to. 
		After working on a number of college and hobby-related sites and projects, my first professional website launched in 2019 for Dr. Melissa Zebley's <em>Mobile Vet to Pet</em> service. 
		I'm currently working as an intern Web developer.

		<p>
			In 2021, John volunteered to head the website of Robotrio, an illustrated audio drama. 
			For this site, he opted to look into using JavaScript features to emulate the benefits of using a framework, 
			using headers and footers as their own files to make the likes of adding or renaming pages far more simplified.

		<p>
			John's latest freelance site, completed in late 2020, was an update and redesign of the St. Pius V Lay Dominican Chapter website. 
			The prompt asked for further interactivity and visual interest, leading John to emphasize CSS style and JavaScript substance in tandem, 
			with a lecture selection page, photo gallery, and even About page (leading to a history section as short or long as viewers want) 
			filled with JavaScript-powered interactive features and responsive designs to compliment them.

		<p>
			John's first professional site was an overhaul of Dr. Melissa Zebley's <em>Mobile Vet to Pet</em> site. 
			The prompt asked for a mobile-friendly, blue-and green redesign with a clean aesthetic, placing an emphasis on accessibility and a fresh atmosphere. 
			In addition to eight pages coded with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, John also gave the title and logo a modernized look, 
			modified a PDF form to add fillable elements, and created an interactive service area map via Google Maps.

		<p>
			Rounding out his college experience in Web technology, John took to the Wix platform to document his video editing and visual effects work. 
			John designed the site to keep potential employers scrolling, utilizing both sheer features offered by the design platform 
			(including a video background and paragraphs fading in upon scrolling to them) 
			and graphic design principles meant to give an atmosphere reminiscent of his Turbulence site while pointing to his skills and growth in editing and visual effects.

		<p>
			John's final HTML-coded college website, from Fall 2019, takes on a lower-fi approach, 
			shifting the emphasis from CSS features to JavaScript integration and ease of use on mobile devices 
			(among other features, this site employs a collapsible &ldquo;hamburger&rdquo; menu for smaller screens) 
			and more professional under-the-hood features such as SEO optimization, XML sitemaps and preprocessed LESS styling. 
			Premised on comparing open source programs' features to those of programs in Adobe's cloud-based suite 
			and switching out his previous site's dark atmosphere with a homemade feel and tongue-in-cheek writing style, 
			the website aims to subtly integrate HTML, CSS and JavaScript into a cohesive whole.

		<a href="https://valtapaz.github.io/turbulence/" target="blank"><img src="images/siteTurbulence.png" class="sitePic" alt="Turbulence website"></a>
		<p>
			After a number of courses that emphasized simple exercises over larger-scale projects, John's next major website in Spring of 2019 took on a more modern approach: 
			it emphasized similar concepts to those found in feature film websites with the stated intent of hand-coding a site that looked like it had been made with a higher-end Web design platform. 
			The website, based on John's fictional works, takes on a dark atmosphere with a seemingly simple aesthetic that hides a variety of CSS tools. 
			Notably, the website utilizes pure CSS to imitate the effects of JavaScript&mdash;from popup windows to a background that appears to change color as a user scrolls, 
			this site pushed John's abilities with CSS to their greatest extent.

		<p>
			John's first coded website, <em>The Zoom Times</em>, was built in 2015 as a capstone project for an Internet Technology course and as a complementary site to his family's blog. 
			It has recieved various updates since its inception, from semantic improvements under the hood to a reworked logo and more universal browser compatibility; 
			more information about its changes are documented in the site's dedicated change log.
